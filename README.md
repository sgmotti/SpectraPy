# OceanOptics gui

# Ciao!

This is the homemade Python version of SpectraSuite, for controlling and running measurements with the Ocean Optics spectrometers. It was tested with Maya, Usb2000 and IRQuest.

The file OceanOptics_GUI.exe is a standalone application that bundles all needed libraries and requires no python installation or additional files. In case it doesn't work, please let me know so I can find and fix the issue.

It works in simulation mode without the devices for testing purpose, and it can also be used to load and visualize spectra from .txt files.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------
To use the spectrometers you should install the driver (seabreeze-3.0.11.zip from https://sourceforge.net/projects/seabreeze/). 

# IMPORTANT: 
Keep in mind this is NOT the same driver used by SpectraSuite, so having both installed in the same computer might give you problems.
